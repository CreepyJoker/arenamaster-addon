# ArenaMaster PvP Inspect AddOn

## Overview

This is a utility addon for ArenaMaster web app: https://arenamaster.io. By installing this addon, you'll be able to easily check any player's arena and rbg experience without having to leave the game.

## Unit Frame Hover

You can hover over a player's unit frame in the open world and see at a glance the highest 2v2, 3v3 and rbg rating they've achieved on the character, or the overall best rating if the player has an ArenaMaster account.

## Battle&#46;net Friends Hover

You can also hover over your Battle&#46;net friends list and quickly determine the experience of your friend's currently played character. Combine this with in-game notes for your friends and a couple of useful addons like **Friend List Colors** and **Friend Groups** and your friend list suddenly becomes a more personal LFG experience.

## Copy ArenaMaster Profile

In addition, you can right-click any character's unit frame to get their ArenaMaster Profile URL where you can see their full PvP information including current rating, win rates, gear, talents, achievements and much more.

Apart from unit frames, you can get the link from anywhere in-game by right-clicking the names in whispers, guild chat, LFG and other places.

The URL is already selected. All you have to do is `CTRL + C` the link and paste it in your browser of choice to get directly to their ArenaMaster Profile.

## Installation

If you're using the Twitch app to manage your addons, <a href="twitch://">open the app</a> and navigate to the Mods -> Get More Addons section where you can find the addon by name.

In case you prefer to download the zip and unpack it in your addons directory yourself, click the [Download from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/).

Once installed and in-game, make sure to only enable the ArenaMaster data for your region by unchecking the other regions inside the AddonList.

Make sure to keep an eye out for updates and update when available. As the web app and addon are in the early stages, there is a chance you'll encounter players that have no data you can view with the addon. You can visit their ArenaMaster profiles in order to add them to our database, and their character data will be available in-game on the next update.

As more players start to use the web app, the data will be updated more frequently and the addon will become more and more useful.
